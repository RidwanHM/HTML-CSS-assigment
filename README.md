<h1>Rainydays</h1>

<p>
I had an assignment about making a responsive website. I could pick between three different companies to do the design for and I choose Rainydays. I have already designed this website in my design assignment.
The starter page got the products, about and contact in it and it goes in column until 1000px breakpoint and it becomes rows. The shopping cart also disappear when in desktop version because I mean it looks finer.
The about you page got a big hero picture, also from unsplashed.com. Under it I put the slogan and on top of it I made a slogan of my own. «Rainydays is more than a store, more than a brand, It’s a lifestyle». I made the last word « lifestyle in a bigger font and made it the same blu color as the logo to the branch. 
Contact us page made it simple with the forms for email, number and type in. Put up a nice image that I found in google that matched the description.
Now if you press the menu logo onn the top left corner it will lead you to the main page. The main page got Main menu, products, about us and contact us. If you click on any of these it will lead you to the page. The product page will lead you to the same page as the one you come to if you click on the «storm breaker» jacket on the main menu. There you can see key features, price and choose size and color. If you click on the add cart it will lead you to another page. This page is the checkout page.
After the checkout page you get directed to the confirmation page that got a button that leads you back to the starter page. Every page is responsive.</p>
